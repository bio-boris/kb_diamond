    <p> DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches, designed for high performance analysis of big sequence data. The key features are:

Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 500x-20,000x speed of BLAST.
Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.
Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard desktops or laptops.
Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML, as well as taxonomic classification.
